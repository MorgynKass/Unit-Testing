This is my introduction to Unit Testing and TDD.

TDD is a concept that makes development more efficient and less prone to unknown errors. 
In TDD you write failing unit tests before you write your actual code to make sure you have a functioning test. This allows you to write refactor your code later on and ensures less mistakes will arise. 
When using unit tests you can organize your code better and diagnose problems faster.
Overall testing your code as you create it is both efficient and can speed things up.
